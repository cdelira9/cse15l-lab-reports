# Lab Report Week 6: Copy whole directories with scp -r

## Markdown-Parse Directory

Using the scp command, I was able to copy the mardown parse directory onto my ieng6 account. The picture
above shows an example on how it logs onto the ieng6 aaccount since it asks for the password and then proceeds to
go through each file and make a copy of it onto the account.
